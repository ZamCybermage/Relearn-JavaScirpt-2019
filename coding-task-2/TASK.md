===============Coding Taks 2===========================

1) Create an array - students, insert four items, which should be objects and have three properties: name,
1st score, 2nd score with the following values:


a) Vladimir, 50, 49
b) Ahmed, 40, 39
c) Jesus, 30, 50
d) Mezdek, 44, 46


2) Suppose that, students have chance to get different degrees of diploma, like Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon
and those degrees are relevant to the following limits 95, 86, 75, 63, 54. According to that, create two arrays for passing limits
and for degrees.

3) Create function which will calculate total score (score-1 + score-2) for each student.

4) Create function and use in it for loops, if else statements etc. in order to figure out which student has passed an exam and what kind of degree he got.

5) Display final results in console.
